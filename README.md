# Project Title: Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview:
I recently completed a project that aimed to predict heart disease using machine learning. The project involved training a model on a dataset of patients with heart disease, and then using the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen patients.

## Objective:
The objective I set for myself was to build a model that accurately predicts heart disease in patients, based on their medical information and lifestyle factors. I trained and tested the model on a dataset of patients, and evaluated the results to determine the accuracy of the model.

## Methodology:
Here's how I approached this project:

- Data Collection: I collected a dataset of patients with heart disease, including their medical information and lifestyle factors.
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: I cleaned and preprocessed the collected data to prepare it for modeling.
- Model Training: I trained a machine learning algorithm on the preprocessed data.
- Model Evaluation: I evaluated the model using accuracy metrics, such as accuracy score and confusion matrix.
- Model Deployment: I used the trained model to predict heart disease in new, unseen patients.

## Expected Results:
The expected results I achieved were an accurate model that can predict heart disease in patients based on their medical information and lifestyle factors. I evaluated the model's accuracy and deployed it for making predictions.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, I successfully completed a project that predicts heart disease in patients using machine learning. The results of this project can be useful for healthcare professionals and researchers who are interested in developing predictive models for heart disease.
